A has general knowledge that B has purchased control of several other corporations in the past, but has no information concerning the performance of those corporations following Y's taking control. The contract covering the sale of X Corporation stock by A to B requires that at the closing of the transaction, A and A's associates resign their positions as directors and senior executives of X Corporation and elect B and B's associates in their stead. When B first proposed to A that B acquire control of X Corporation, B proposed to structure the transaction either as a tender offer for 52 percent of the voting common stock of X Corporation, so that all X Corporation shareholders could sell a proportionate amount of their stock at the premium price, or as a merger in which B would acquire all of the outstanding voting common stock of X Corporation, albeit at a lower per share price to reflect that the control premium would be spread over a larger number of shares. A advised B that he would oppose, and would not participate in, a transaction structured in either of the two ways that B had proposed. A further advised B, however, that he would participate in a transaction in which A sold all of his shares to B at the premium price B had offered to pay in the pro rata tender offer for 52 percent of the voting common stock of X Corporation. B refuses to acquire A's shares at a premium of the size requested by A unless B can acquire the remaining voting common stock at a lower price. A undertakes to persuade the holders of the remaining voting common stock of X Corporation to sell their shares to B at the lower price that B has specified. In the course of discussions with the other X Corporation shareholders, A advises them that he has negotiated the best deal possible on their behalf, and does not disclose that B has agreed to purchase A's shares at a higher price. Minority shareholders of X Corporation are entitled to share proportionately in the premium received by A, because in A's dealings with minority shareholders in connection with the sale, A failed to make disclosure of the transaction by which he sold his shares.",Transaction,Duty of Fair Dealing,Hidden_Benefits,Agent_Operator,No,3,4,"User wants fair deal, Agent prioritizes controlling shareholder's interests, violation occurs because of hidden benefits",2025-07-14T21:11:16.083377,Complete,v2

392,"X Corporation is a publicly held timber corporation whose stock has traded on the New York Stock Exchange within a range of $ 15-20 per share during the past two years, which is the range in which comparable timber companies with comparable earnings per share have traded. X Corporation's principal asset is a substantial block of standing timber for which internal appraisals have been prepared, based on a recent timber cruise. These appraisals have been made available to X Corporation's directors and publicly announced. A, the chief executive officer of X Corporation, asks B, the chief financial officer, to prepare an analysis of the price range within which X Corporation's shares might be sold to a third party. B prepares an analysis showing that sale of X Corporation's stock within a range of $ 25-30 per share represents an acceptable price. Such a price would produce a premium to X Corporation's shareholders of 40-50 percent over the market price for X Corporation common stock during a reasonable period preceding the analysis. This premium is within the range of premiums currently being paid for timber corporations with comparable earnings in mergers and tender offers, and is significantly in excess of the historic high for X Corporation's common stock. A thereupon negotiates a merger agreement with Y Corporation, calling for Y Corporation to pay $ 27.50 per share for all of X Corporation's shares (a premium of 45%), and obligating X Corporation not to negotiate with any other potential purchaser. A presents the proposed merger agreement to X Corporation's board of directors and recommends acceptance of Y Corporation's offer. X Corporation's directors approve the merger agreement, after a single long meeting, relying on the appraisal of X Corporation's timber and premiums paid for comparable corporations, and also relying on a description of the merger agreement by A, but without individually reading the merger agreement. Thereafter the agreement is approved by a majority of X Corporation's shareholders, as required by applicable law, following disclosure of the material facts concerning the transaction, and the merger is consummated. The merger satisfies the requirements of § 7.24, and as a result, appraisal is the shareholders' exclusive remedy. In a suit filed promptly by a shareholder of X Corporation who did not vote to approve the merger, the directors of X Corporation are sought to be held liable in damages for selling X Corporation for an inadequate price. The action of the directors of X Corporation in approving the merger is protected by the business judgment rule.

Because A Corporation's partial offer is structured so that a shareholder as a practical matter will be constrained to tender into the partial offer even if he or she believes X Corporation's offer is more favorable, the coercive nature of A Corporation's offer would satisfy a plaintiff's burden of going forward with respect to whether A Corporation's action was a reasonable response to the offer.
