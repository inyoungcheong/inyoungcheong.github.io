  abstract={Large language models (LLMs) have the potential for significant benefits, but they also pose risks such as privacy infringement, discrimination propagation, and virtual abuse. By developing and examining “worst-case” scenarios that illustrate LLM-based harms, this paper identifies that U.S. law may not be adequate in addressing threats to fundamental human rights posed by LLMs. The shortcomings arise from the primary focus of U.S. laws on governmental intrusion rather than market injustices, the complexities of LLM-related harms, and the intangible nature of these harms. As Section 230 protections for online intermediaries may not extend to AI-generated content, LLM developers must demonstrate due diligence (alignment efforts) to defend themselves against potential claims. Moving forward, we should consider ex-ante safety regulations adapted to LLMs to give clearer guidelines to the fast-paced AI development. Innovative interpretations or amendments to the Bills of Rights may be necessary to prevent the perpetuation of bias and uphold socio-economic rights.}

  abstract={Can content moderation on social media be considered a form of speech? If so, would government regulation of content moderation violate the First Amendment? These are the main arguments of social media companies after Florida and Texas legislators attempted to restrict social media platforms’ authority to de-platform objectionable content.
This article examines whether social media companies’ arguments have valid legal grounds. To this end, the article proposes three elements to determine that algorithms classify as “speech:” (1) the algorithms are designed to communicate messages; (2) the relevant messages reflect cognitive or emotive ideas beyond mere operational matters; and (3) they represent the company’s standpoints. The application of these elements makes it clear that social media algorithms can be considered speech when algorithms are designed to express companies’ values, ethics, and identity (as they often are).
However, conceptualizing algorithms as speech does not automatically award a social media company a magic shield against state or federal regulation. It is true that social media platforms’ position is likely to be favored by the U.S. Supreme Court, which has increasingly taken an all-or-nothing approach whereby “all speech invokes strict scrutiny of government regulation.” Instead, this article argues for the restoration of the Court’s approach prior to the 1970s, when decisions emphasized considerations such as the democratic values of speech, the irreplaceability of forums, and the socioeconomic inequality of speakers and audiences.
Under the latter principles, social media companies’ market dominance and their harmful effect on juveniles or political polarization would justify legislative efforts to increase algorithmic transparency even if they restrict social media’s free speech. Therefore, most big tech companies’ algorithms can and should be regulated for legitimate government purposes.}

  abstract={This article aims to introduce the landscape of American civil penalties to Korean legal academia by analyzing U.S. federal statutes and case laws in areas such as antitrust, securities regulations, occupational safety, and environmental protection. The analysis highlights the growing authority of administrative agencies in imposing monetary penalties, replacing traditional court proceedings. American scholars have raised concerns about the constitutionality of administrative civil penalties. Issues include the blurred distinction between criminal and civil penalties, potentially violating the Double Jeopardy Clause and the Seventh Amendment's right to a jury trial. Moreover, current practices may encourage coerced settlements, where individuals accept administrative agency deals under the threat of criminal penalties. As a result, U.S. federal civil penalties have theoretical and practical flaws.
The article references the Jackesy v. SEC case, where the Fifth Circuit ruled that the SEC's civil penalties violated the Seventh Amendment due to the lack of a jury trial in administrative procedures. However, the article critiques the "public rights" theory in the Fifth Circuit's opinion, arguing that it lacks solid grounding in U.S. case law. Instead, the article suggests developing more effective judicial review systems for administrative penalties, acknowledging that courts may not be well-equipped to handle all disputes efficiently.
The evolution of U.S. federal civil penalties provides insights for South Korean penalty systems, reflecting the challenge of balancing conflicting values like adversarial legalism, due process, cost-efficient policy implementation, and administrative accountability.}
