I am a fifth-year PhD Student and Affiliate Faculty at the UW School of Law, teaching Technology Law and Public Policy Seminar ([syllabus](https://inyoungcheong.notion.site/LAW-E553-79718cccf6f54679a2b0c7a08eaf6d5f)). Advised by <strong>[Tadayoshi Kohno](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yoshi/)</strong>, I conduct multi-disciplinary research on AI safety, alignment, and regulatory principles at the <strong>[Security & Privacy Lab](https://seclab.cs.washington.edu/people/)</strong>,<strong> [Tech Policy Lab](https://techpolicylab.uw.edu/about/#our-people)</strong>, and <strong>[Social Futures Lab](https://social.cs.washington.edu/)</strong>. I received prestigious grants from <strong>Fulbright</strong>, <strong>OpenAI</strong>, and UW Alumni. My research was presented at major conferences like ICML, KSEA, and Trust & Safety Research Conference.  

I wrote <strong>[Freedom of Algorithmic Expression](https://scholarship.law.uc.edu/uclr/vol91/iss3/2/)</strong> (2023), which explored whether social media platforms' content moderation algorithms can be considered a <strong>form of speech</strong> under the First Amendment. My current focus is on <strong>[Generative AI and Law for Humanities](https://genlaw.github.io/CameraReady/32.pdf)</strong>. My thoughts on Generative AI and Fair Use appeared in the <strong>[Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/ai-chatgpt-dall-e-microsoft-rutkowski-github-artificial-intelligence-11675466857?mod=latest_headlines)</strong>.

Before arriving in Seattle, I was a <strong>regulator and policymaker</strong> in South Korea, as Deputy Director at the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism (2016-2019) and the Korea Communications Commission (2012-2016). In 2020, I assisted the <strong>United Nations</strong>' Under-Secretary-General in formulating strategic partnerships with South Korean local governments. More details re: my professional experience is outlined in my [CV](https://inyoungcheong.github.io/cv/).
