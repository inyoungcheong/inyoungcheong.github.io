<br>
I am a <strong>fifth-year PhD Student</strong> and <strong>Affiliate Faculty</strong> at the University of Washington School of Law, teaching Technology Law and Public Policy Seminar ([syllabus](https://inyoungcheong.notion.site/LAW-E553-79718cccf6f54679a2b0c7a08eaf6d5f)). Advised by [Tadayoshi Kohno](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yoshi/), I conduct multi-disciplinary research on AI ethics and platform governance at the [Security & Privacy Lab](https://seclab.cs.washington.edu/people/), [Tech Policy Lab](https://techpolicylab.uw.edu/about/#our-people), and [Social Futures Lab](https://social.cs.washington.edu/). I received prestigious grants from <strong>Fulbright</strong>, <strong>OpenAI</strong>, and <strong>UW Alumni</strong>. My research was presented at major conferences like <strong>ICML</strong>, <strong>KSEA</strong>, and <strong>Trust & Safety Research Conference</strong>.  

My research focuses on how algorithmic decision-making has impacted the norms of free speech and privacy. I wrote an article called <strong>"[Freedom of Algorithmic Expression](https://scholarship.law.uc.edu/uclr/vol91/iss3/2/)"</strong> (2023), which explored whether social media platforms' content moderation algorithms can be considered a <strong>form of speech</strong> under the First Amendment. My current focus is on <strong>"[Generative AI and Law for Humanities](https://genlaw.github.io/CameraReady/32.pdf)."</strong> My thoughts on Generative AI and Fair Use appeared in the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/ai-chatgpt-dall-e-microsoft-rutkowski-github-artificial-intelligence-11675466857?mod=latest_headlines).

Before arriving in Seattle, I was a <strong>regulator and policymaker</strong> in South Korea. As Deputy Director at the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism (2016-2019) and the Korea Communications Commission (2012-2016), I drafted and executed multiple laws and regulations to preserve the freedom of expression and universal access to communication services. In 2020, I assisted the United Nations' Under-Secretary-General in formulating strategic partnerships with South Korean local governments. More details re: my professional experience is outlined in my [CV](https://inyoungcheong.github.io/cv/).
