Inyoung Cheong is an Affiliate Instructor, teaching Technology Law and Public Policy, and Fulbright Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Washington School of Law.

Her research focuses on how algorithmic decision-making has impacted on the norms of free speech and privacy. She wrote an article called, “Freedom of Algorithmic Expression,” (University of Cincinnati Law Review, 2023), which explored whether social media platforms’ content moderation algorithms can be considered a form of speech under the First Amendment. She is currently working on “Generative AI and Law for Humanities.” Her thoughts on Generative AI and Fair Use appeared in the <a href='https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/ai-chatgpt-dall-e-microsoft-rutkowski-github-artificial-intelligence-11675466857?mod=latest_headlines'>Wall Street Journal</a>.

She conducts her multi-disciplinary research with her peers and her advisor, <a href='https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yoshi/'>Tadayoshi Kohno</a>, at the <a href='https://seclab.cs.washington.edu/people/'>Security & Privacy Lab</a> and <a href='https://techpolicylab.uw.edu/about/#our-people'>Tech Policy Lab</a>.

Before arriving in Seattle, she was Deputy Director at the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism and the Korea Communications Commission in 2012-2019. Also, she assisted the United Nations’ Under-Secretary-General in formulating strategic partnership with South Korean local governments in 2020.
