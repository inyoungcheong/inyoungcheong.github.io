Through this support, we pioneered participatory research establishing a case-based approach for professional AI advice systems. <a href="http://social.cs.washington.edu/case-law-ai-policy/">Our project website</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10934">our paper</a> selected for NeurIPS 2023 MP2 Workshop details the process. As part of this work, I led an expert workshop eliciting perspectives on the appropriateness of legal guidance from AI chatbots. This blog post summarizes key insights on ensuring responsible, ethical AI assistance in the legal domain.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <!-- Fallback to the original file --> <img src="/assets/img/blog/lawyer_ai.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> figure: Inyoung Cheong </div> <p>As AI-based chatbots become increasingly sophisticated, people are turning to robots for expert knowledge — medical advice, legal counsel, financial planning — once largely inaccessible or unaffordable. Now, people utilize AI-powered chatbots to get personalized guidance and customized answers to their most pressing questions. Law is one such high demand area. Despite how regularly people encounter legal issues — rental agreements, divorce filings, and noise disputes with neighbors, for example — lawyers are notoriously expensive.</p> <p>However, there are many valid concerns around chatbots providing legal advice. To name a few, inaccuracy in the guidance could lead to detrimental real-world outcomes. Additionally, potential data breaches pose privacy risks given the sensitive nature of legal matters. There are also worries about bias and unfair recommendations, as well as lack of interpretability around how the chatbot arrives at suggestions. Further concerns include misuse or abuse of the legal advice provided, especially when not constrained by professional ethics and conduct standards lawyers are held to.</p> <p>In this sense, EU AI law (draft) puts AI systems used for “Assistance in legal interpretation and application of the law” into the high-risk category. While the convenience and accessibility of chatbots for legal guidance is appealing, these systems must be developed thoughtfully to address the many risks accompanying such a powerful application.</p> <p>There has been very little research specifically examining the factors that determine the appropriateness of AI systems providing professional guidance. Prior scholarship has discussed AI advice mainly in broad, speculative terms rather than conducting in-depth studies grounded in real-world use cases and expert perspectives. This research gap motivated our qualitative study engaging domain experts, legal professionals. By eliciting lawyers’ insights on sample cases, we aimed to develop a detailed, nuanced understanding of when AI recommendations are viewed as proper versus irresponsible.</p> <h2 id="research-design">Research Design</h2> <p>We conducted an in-depth study to understand when legal AI advice is viewed as appropriate by experts like lawyers. Our goal was to build a detailed, contextual understanding of the appropriateness of AI legal advice grounded in the perspectives of experts like lawyers who provide such counsel professionality.</p> <blockquote> <p>Question: When is it appropriate for AI systems to give advice in the legal domain?</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h3> <p>We collected sample “seed cases” representing real user queries needing legal advice. For example:</p> <blockquote> <p>“I run a popular online mobile game with microtransactions and collect user data per our terms. We run ads too. What should our legal strategy cover?”</p> </blockquote> <p>We then presented these cases to legal professionals along with hypothetical AI responses.</p> <h3 id="participatory-workshops">Participatory Workshops</h3> <p>We then conducted six remote participatory workshops with 20 legal experts, including active lawyers in the UK and the US, law professors, and two law students. We presented the seed cases along with hypothetical AI responses based on patterns seen in state-of-the-art, free for use, and public-facing models like GPT-3.</p> <p>Response templates included:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Template Name</th> <th>Description</th> <th>Example Response (Legal Advice)</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Content violation</td> <td>Displays a warning message that the user’s input violates the AI’s content policy.</td> <td>This content may violate our content policy. If you believe this to be in error, please submit your feedback—your input will aid our research in this area.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Refuse to answer</td> <td>Avoids providing a response to the input and advises the user to seek professional advice instead.</td> <td>As an AI model, I am not a substitute for consulting with a trained professional. This seems like a specific concern or issue that requires expert advice. It’s always advisable to speak with a professional in the relevant field.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>High-level answer without facts</td> <td>Provides a response that answers the input in broad strokes, stating advice rather than facts.</td> <td>I am not a lawyer, but I can provide some general information about possible legal strategies that might be used in a situation like this. 1. Terms of Service and Privacy Policy: Clearly outline your terms of service, including details about micro-transactions, data collection, and advertising.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Specific answer with facts</td> <td>Provides a detailed response that cites specific facts relevant to the input.</td> <td>I am not a lawyer, but I can provide some information about specific legal strategies that may be applied in a situation like this. 1. Compliance with Applicable Laws and Regulations: Laws like the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) may be relevant.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Ask a follow-up question</td> <td>Responds with a question requesting more information.</td> <td>To help you with this, I will need some additional information. Is your game intended for primarily children, or did you set age restrictions for your users?</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Semi-structured discussions focused on key factors shaping the perceived appropriateness and risks of different AI advisor response styles for 2-3 seed cases that experts chose. Experts took turns presenting factors that they took into account while envisioning the most desirable AI responses. After each workshop, we compiled the identified factors for analysis.</p> <p>Re: popular online mobile game prompt, key dimensions considered by experts for that case include:</p> <ul> <li>Location of operation (whether the mobile game operates in the states having privacy law)</li> <li>Ad providers’ data collection practices (are ad providers also collecting data)</li> <li>Involvement of minors (whether there are users who fall under a certain age)</li> <li>Nature of data (what kind of user information is being collected?)</li> <li>Terms of service (language and terminology used in the terms of service)</li> </ul> <h2 id="key-factors-identified">Key Factors Identified</h2> <p>Analysis of discussions with lawyers revealed numerous key dimensions that influence suitable AI guidance. Key factors spanned categories shown below:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Category</th> <th>Factors Considered</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>User Attributes</td> <td>Sophistication, Geography, Identity, Status, Reliability, Agency</td> </tr> <tr> <td>User Query</td> <td>Scope, Stakes, Information Sufficiency, Desired Response Type, Judgment Needed</td> </tr> <tr> <td>AI Capabilities</td> <td>Accuracy, Context-Awareness, Interpretability, Novelty</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Legal Aspects</td> <td>Ambiguity, Complexity, Standard Practices</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Potential Impact</td> <td>User Emotions, Justice System</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3 id="differing-views-on-the-capabilities-of-ai">Differing Views on the Capabilities of AI.</h3> <p>Opinions differ on the capabilities of current AI systems. Some believe AI can contextualize information and even surpass lawyers in processing huge amounts of legal data. However, others remain skeptical due to the risk of inaccuracies. There was consensus that the need for AI advice depends partly on AI capabilities advancing responsibly and transparently. However, even assuming that AI systems could be made completely accurate and secure, concerns would still exist around AI systems providing actionable recommendations.</p> <h3 id="chatbots-arent-bound-by-ethics-rules">Chatbots Aren’t Bound by Ethics Rules.</h3> <p>Experts indicate that human lawyers are bound by ethics rules (e.g., confidentiality, competent representation, conflicts of interest, malpractice) and can face disciplinary action if they violate them. Chatbots don’t have legal or ethical duties. Hypothetically, they can represent both sides, share information with others without consent, or give bad advice. Without oversight mechanisms, chatbots lack accountability for improper guidance. This heightens risks in relying on AI legal advice.</p> <h3 id="legal-information-is-different-from-advice">Legal information is different from advice.</h3> <p>Experts largely concurred that discussing general legal information is appropriate, much like search engines already provide. However, personalized advice requires professional judgment. Participants emphasized keeping responses as non-binding information statements (“if this, then that”), rather than opinions on users’ specific cases. A participant believes the AI should refuse to answer a question like “could I win a lawsuit” altogether, since determining something like that involves nuanced legal analysis and human judgment that the AI cannot replicate.</p> <p>Professionals emphasized that AI should focus on addressing purely informational queries lacking situational specifics. For instance, discussing high-level legal principles, rights and procedures is considered as “general knowledge” and poses less risk than advising actions for a user’s nuanced case. This aligns with court rulings differentiating neutral education from individualized recommendations reserved for licensed attorneys, although the distinction between two concepts is somewhat blurry.</p> <h3 id="a-chatbot-should-indicate-its-speculative-responses-may-be-incomplete">A chatbot should indicate its speculative responses may be incomplete.</h3> <p>Experts generally agree that AI systems cannot make a comprehensive analysis because of inherently insufficient facts and details. Attempting complex legal analysis with limited information risks generating misleading or speculative outputs. A participant gave an example of a DACA recipient charged with driving under intoxication, which could potentially result in deportation as a crime of moral turpitude. The recipient’s DACA status could completely change the strategy for plea bargaining in this scenario. However, it is unrealistic to expect an AI system to inquire about DACA status whenever asked about a drunken driving charge. Therefore, AI responses should acknowledge that they do not provide a complete picture. The appropriate response when presented with vague hypothetical scenarios seems to be recognizing that there are insufficient facts provided, and additional details could significantly alter the analysis and outcomes. Making firm legal judgments without a full understanding of a situation’s specifics is problematic.</p> <h3 id="asking-users-follow-up-questions-was-generally-encouraged">Asking users follow-up questions was generally encouraged.</h3> <p>While acknowledging the limitations of making definitive legal conclusions with incomplete information, experts largely agreed that AI systems should have the ability to ask users follow-up questions to clarify hypothetical situations presented. Since initial prompts from laypeople often lack legally relevant facts, asking clarifying questions can help the chatbot distill the most legally meaningful information for further analysis and improve the user’s ability to “ask a better question.”</p> <p>However, some experts were not inclined toward AI systems retrieving extensive personal details from users due to potential security concerns. They cautioned that collecting excessive information could increase vulnerability if confidentiality is compromised. In this regard, experts underscored that users must be clearly and transparently informed about data handling policies and consent to any collection of sensitive information (“Protections in place so that confidential information isn’t reused or leaked.”).</p> <h3 id="chatbot-conversations-are-not-confidential-risking-harms-on-non-users">Chatbot conversations are not confidential, risking harms on non-users.</h3> <p>Unlike private attorney conversations, chatbot interactions are “essentially public,” able to be shared widely online. This publicity poses risks around legal advice “taken out of context.” For instance, if a hate crime suspect asked about their legal defense, the chatbot response may include what “could offend some groups.” While attorneys can tailor guidance to clients privately, chatbots cannot adapt publicly visible responses.</p> <h3 id="certain-legal-domains-are-better-suited-for-machine-guided-decisions">Certain legal domains are better suited for machine-guided decisions.</h3> <p>All legal domains are not created equal. It’s important to recognize that established business practices allow professionals to make routine decisions easily. Experts were more inclined to give detailed answers to informational questions like identifying states with low corporate tax rates or the legality of using lie detectors during the interrogation, which has the “objective answer” in the legal world. Experts found answering these clearly informational questions analogous to Google search results. Although stakes were high, some experts agreed to advise on states allowing medically-assisted death for permanent diseases.</p> <p>However, there are complex and ambiguous areas like tax law where attorneys frequently have to make judgment calls based on experience. Also, many experts strongly cautioned against relying solely on AI in criminal cases, where plea bargains consider nuanced, subjective factors like a judge’s interests and religion. Having quality legal representation is significant from due process principles.</p> <p>In domains with great complexity and subjectivity, it is found to be not practical or advisable to depend entirely on AI legal assistance. The human judgment of an attorney remains critical for handling nuance and weighing various factors. While AI can provide information and analysis, human expertise is still vital in areas like criminal law or other fields requiring deep judgment calls. Users should be aware of the limitations of AI in handling subjective or highly ambiguous legal situations. Expert counsel remains key in these contexts.</p> <h3 id="experts-distinguish-between-ai-for-lawyers-and-ai-for-the-general-public">Experts distinguish between AI for lawyers and AI for the general public.</h3> <p>While we approached this workshop considering public-facing use cases, experts noted meaningful distinctions between AI systems aimed at assisting legal professionals versus those intended for use by the general public. They expressed that AI designed as a “co-pilot” for lawyers may be viewed more positively, as it can help reduce human error while lawyers retain responsibility (”Using machines to help or do us do our job; I think it’s seen as generally positive.”). AI could be valuable for lawyers by streamlining “intake processes” and honing the specifics of legal issues, given appropriate confidentiality protections.</p> <p>However, public-facing legal AI systems impose greater risks on layperson users who lack legal expertise. Unlike enterprise solutions with balanced liability sharing, consumer legal AI products may have one-sided indemnification clauses leaving users vulnerable. Without the context to properly evaluate AI limitations, the public may develop an undue reliance. Therefore, experts emphasized the need for careful precautions around AI intended for public consumption, including transparent terms of service, clear explanation of risks, and reasonable limitations on use cases to avoid exploiting user expectations.</p> <h3 id="ai-systems-should-respect-users-agency">AI systems should respect users’ agency.</h3> <p>Experts emphasize that the user retains autonomy; the AI is meant to augment human decision-making by providing additional information, not replace accountable judgment. When providing analysis or recommendations, AI systems designed for high-stakes fields like law should respect that human discretion still dominates suitability considerations over algorithmic intelligence. As such, the AI’s outputs should avoid emotional manipulation or pressure tactics that could improperly sway users’ objective, reasoned choices.</p> <p>Furthermore, introducing an “emotional quotient” risk making unsupported assumptions about people’s internal states and motivations. This could lead to unfair profiling or inappropriate advice with real consequences, especially without human oversight. It can note potential risks or caution about harmful outcomes but should couch these as uncertainties rather than absolutes. By respecting human agency and discretion, AI systems can enhance legal advice without undermining users’ self-determination. The goal is empowering informed decisions, not imposing prescribed paths.</p> <p>While AI cannot (or should not) entirely replicate or replace a lawyer’s judgment, our study elucidates how to create transparent AI assistants that know when to defer to human experts. With thoughtful design, AI can expand access to legal knowledge while avoiding reliance on imperfect machine intelligence for decisions with serious consequences. But only through considering the multitude of human, technological and regulatory dimensions revealed by experts can AI truly complement legal professionals in an ethical manner.</p> <h2 id="contribution">Contribution</h2> <p>This research makes several notable contributions towards developing more trustworthy and human-centered AI systems. First, it pioneers a new methodology for participatory technology ethics, engaging diverse stakeholders in evaluating AI responses based on real-world cases. This collaborative assessment approach represents a significant evolution beyond speculative principles or theoretical frameworks.</p> <p>Second, the insights generated from this process make tangible progress towards actionable guidelines for imbuing AI systems with sound judgement aligned to professional and community values. By grounding evaluations in practical examples and focusing on nuanced criteria of appropriateness, the findings provide targeted guidance for improving reliability and transparency.</p> <p>Finally, this research lays the foundation for a scalable model of participatory AI ethics that can be expanded across other professional domains. The methods and insights establish a framework for incorporating human-centered design principles through cooperative evaluation of AI systems. This has the potential to greatly enhance user trust and satisfaction by creating technologies that better serve their needs and align with their values.</p> <p>This work makes pioneering steps toward ensuring AI is developed responsibly and ethically with consideration for its real-world impacts on people and society. The participatory assessment process, context-specific findings, and potential for transferring the approach to other fields represent significant contributions in the pursuit of trustworthy AI.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Musings_on_AI,"/><category term="Academic_life"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lawyers perspectives on when AI chatbots can appropriately provide legal guidance.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Website renewal 🤩</title><link href="https://inyoungcheong.github.io/blog/2023/newsite/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Website renewal 🤩"/><published>2023-10-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-10-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://inyoungcheong.github.io/blog/2023/newsite</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://inyoungcheong.github.io/blog/2023/newsite/"><![CDATA[<p><i>I’ve open-sourced the code for my website on GitHub - feel free to tinker with your own version <a href="https://github.com/inyoungcheong/inyoungcheong.github.io">here</a>.</i></p> <h4 id="three-months-with-github-page">Three months with Github Page.</h4> <p>It’s hard to believe it’s already been three or four months since I created this website. At this stage of life, I value archiving memories in ANY form, so I’m recapping my experience building this site.</p> <p>I had to learn Visual Studio, GitHub, and Jekyll (specifically the <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a> template) to construct the site. As I described <a href="https://inyoungcheong.github.io/blog/2023/adieu-wordpress/">earlier</a>, picking up these new skills as a non-programmer was a steep curve! However, I appreciate everything being free - no URL fees, unlimited uploads, embedding abilities.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <!-- Fallback to the original file --> <img src="/assets/img/blog/Screenshot.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> On my current screen. </div> <p>The mobile experience can be glitchy, like my CV not displaying on certain browsers. But overall, I like having full control to add anything I want by finding solutions through Google. In just a few months, I’ve gained new tech skills while creating a personalized platform to preserve memories. Though challenging at times, it’s been a worthwhile endeavor.</p> <hr/> <h4 id="what-i-didnt-like-about-the-previous-version">What I didn’t like about the previous version.</h4> <p>However, as you can see, I haven’t uploaded as much academic writing on tech law as I would have liked. These topics require critical thinking and substantial literature review. Staring at the blank screen in Visual Studio soon sapped my motivation for such mentally taxing writing. The programmer-like working environment poses a major obstacle, unless I’m doing something inherently enjoyable like a <a href="https://inyoungcheong.github.io/blog/2023/maria-schneider/">book review</a> or reunion announcement for my <a href="https://inyoungcheong.github.io/blog/2023/jeonmindong/">Korean friends</a>.</p> <p>Because I was preoccupied with learning the basics of Jekyll and GitHub Pages, I didn’t make many customizations to the Al-folio <a href="https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/">template</a>.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <!-- Fallback to the original file --> <img src="/assets/img/blog/website.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>However, there were a few points I wasn’t satisfied with:</p> <ul> <li>Limited news items. Some people have long publication lists which look impressive (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/inyoungcheong/inyoungcheong.github.io">Chan Young</a> and <a href="https://github.com/inyoungcheong/inyoungcheong.github.io">Amy</a>).</li> <li>Al-folio is very popular, so many sites look identical. I wanted my site to have an authentic style.</li> <li>Fancy icons for selected publications take up too much space.</li> <li>As my blogging becomes more personal, people in my professional network may not need to see these posts on the main page.</li> </ul> <p>My partner 👨🏻‍🎨 gave me candid feedback on my lengthy intro paragraph: "Nobody will read all this." He suggested highlighting just my core titles like PhD Candidate and OpenAI grant recipient. Additional details could live on separate pages, avoiding one dense intro. While implementing separate pages felt too complex, I did add resume-style hashtags below my headshot.</p> <hr/> <h4 id="website-redesign-key-enhancements">Website Redesign: Key enhancements</h4> <p>Thus, I made the following enhancements:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Altered</strong> the color theme using <a href="https://inyoungcheong.github.io/blog/2023/tools/#1-pantone-color-palette-">Pantone color palette</a>.</li> <li><strong>Font change powered by <a href="https://inyoungcheong.github.io/blog/2023/tools/#4-google-fonts">Google fonts</a>.</strong></li> <li><strong>Removed</strong> the affiliation from my subtitle to streamline the header and draw focus to my name.</li> <li><strong>Moved</strong> links to my LinkedIn, Google Scholar, etc. to the bottom of the introduction to declutter the sidebar.</li> <li><strong>Updated my headshot with a more casual photo.</strong></li> <li><strong>Centered</strong> my profile photo with ample whitespace on both sides for a clear look.</li> <li><strong>Added</strong> hashtags highlighting my core research areas and projects to allow visitors to quickly identify my work.</li> <li><strong>Displayed</strong> my publications and talks on the homepage itself and organized them chronologically by year.</li> </ul> <p>The current homepage looks like this:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <!-- Fallback to the original file --> <img src="/assets/img/blog/website2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Version of 10-24-2023. </div> <p>Overhauling my site's appearance took about two full days of effort.

I prepared Korean food while everyone else brought desserts and drinks. Among the highlights was a fruit punch fountain set up by one friend and another friend introduced his homemade cherry vodka. Combining fruit punch, Bacardi, and the cherry vodka resulted in a perfect cocktail, which we named “Alon” to honor the fountain builder.</p> <p>It was a nice and cordial gathering but came with an expense, a hangover. Sunday was meant for tackling tasks, just like any other grad student attempting to catch up after procrastinate during the weekend. However, the hangover drained my mental energy, forcing me to spend most of the afternoon in bed. Eventually, I managed a challenging trip to the public library, where I stumbled upon a book among the Librarians’ Picks. Despite my usual hesitation with translated books, this one felt different. The English sentences seemed to capture the French sentiment with precision.</p> <h3 id="maria-schneider-an-unknown-name">Maria Schneider: An Unknown Name</h3> <p>The book assumed everyone knew Maria Schneider, yet I had never heard of her. Even the notorious film “Last Tango in Paris,” a sensational 70s classic and one of Schneider’s most well-known works, was unfamiliar to me. It could be that the film had been censored in South Korea, where I grew up, leading to limited awareness and discussion. Nonetheless, I was able to deduce that the movie created waves globally, granting Maria fame along with a complex life marked by occasional and random humiliations and stigmatization.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <!-- Fallback to the original file --> <img src="/assets/img/blog/maria1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> My Cousin Maria Schneider by Vanessa Schneider </div> <h3 id="she-didnt-want-to-talk-about-tango">She didn’t want to talk about Tango.</h3> <p>According to the book, Schneider didn’t like being interviewed, and when she had to, she asked the interviewers to refrain from asking about Tango. She wished to avoid revisiting the memory of those scenes due to the brutal working environment she endured. Marlon Brando, a dominant figure in Hollywood and Europe, adhered to strict work hours, while nineteen-year-old Maria was subjected to over 14-hour workdays, seven days a week. She was aware of the nude scenes, but the extent of their brutality was undisclosed.</p> <p>The infamous “butter” scene, a recurring theme in the book, remained vivid. Maria was unaware of a scene involving sodomy assisted by butter. When Marlon Brando unexpectedly applied butter to her body, she screamed and cried in an attempt to escape the set. Shockingly, Brando and director Bertolucci had conspired to surprise Maria with this scene, filming it despite her distress. The fear and humiliation she experienced were deliberate.</p> <p>Bertolucci <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/revisiting-bernardo-bertoluccis-artistic-ambitions-and-abuses-in-last-tango-in-paris">recalled</a>:</p> <blockquote> “I feel guilty but I do not regret. You know, to make movies is sometime to obtain something. I think that you have to be completely free. I didn’t want Maria to act her humiliation, her rage. I wanted Maria to feel, not to act, the rage and the humiliation.” </blockquote> <h3 id="a-reckoning-in-2016-her-experience-re-defined-as-a-rape">A Reckoning in 2016: Her Experience Re-defined as a “Rape”</h3> <p>During the MeToo movement, Bertolucci’s statement gained rightful attention. Female celebrities retweeted his words, expressing disgust and outrage. Maria’s recollection struck a chord: “I should have called my agent. I should have called my lawyer. I should have had them remove the scene. But I was too young to know all that.”</p> <p>Two influential men in the film industry conspired to humiliate her in the name of artistic expression, for whatever it’s worth. She was told, “It’s all like that. You should know how lucky you are. You were ‘discovered’ as Marlon Brando’s stunning lover character. Other girls would DIE for this opportunity.” When her life unraveled due to drug addiction, they blamed her for not handling fame well. She was enshrined in fame, the entertainment industry’s most valuable currency, yet couldn’t bear the weight of the crown.</p> <p>I watched a couple of video clips from Tango, and she appeared as a benign, docile actress who spoke English awkwardly. But in the following video, she looked like a mature, cool French woman who doesn’t care much about others’ judgment.</p> <div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HKWTSAskXs" title="Maria Schneider speaking about female objectification" width="560"></iframe> </div> <p>It’s truly disheartening that such a talented young woman, skilled in painting, who would dance through the night, and never be intimidated by famous individuals, gradually succumbed to a world that reduced her to the size of her breasts and trapped her in a role imposed upon her at the age of 19.</p> <h3 id="maria-schneider-and-nan-goldin">Maria Schneider and Nan Goldin</h3> <p>While she didn’t often engage in photoshoots, she did agree to pose for Nan Goldin, who had been commissioned by Vogue. Nan Goldin, a female photographer renowned for capturing the authentic and romantic aspects of individuals in the 60s and 70s, left a profound impact with her realistic work. I’ve always admired the colors, unique angles, and genuine expressions conveyed in her photography. In the photo taken by Nan Goldin, Maria Schneider appears akin to Juliette Binoche—an embodiment of sophistication, artistry, and a sense of enduring fame while still charting her individual path. I speculate that this is the image Maria Schneider aspired to project: a combination of jeans-clad comfort, a sophisticated appearance, and unshakable confidence.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <!-- Fallback to the original file --> <img src="/assets/img/blog/maria2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Maria Schneider taken by Nan Goldin </div> <h3 id="vanessa-another-main-figure-in-this-memoir">Vanessa, another main figure in this memoir.</h3> <p>This book was written by political journalist Vanessa Schneider. She has been working at Le Monde and Libération, the most influential newspapers in France. She is an “elite” who graduated from Science Po, one of the best schools in Paris, where young souls questioning social values and causes spend their 20s. Vanessa and Maria built a kindship because of the connection between Maria and Vanessa’s father, a young uncle who was like an older brother.</p> <p>Maria doesn’t have parental figures in her life. Her biological father was a famous movie star <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_G%C3%A9lin">Daniel Gelin</a>, who did not recognize her as a daughter. Her mother, who was also young, was unable to care for her, leading to Maria’s being entrusted to a nurse when she was just 10 years old. Vanessa’s parents, referred to as Papa and Maman in the book, stepped in, welcoming Maria into their home until the birth of their own daughter, Vanessa. Financial constraints meant they couldn’t afford a larger apartment that would accommodate both a teenager like Maria and an infant. Consequently, Maria’s life took a homeless turn, eventually finding her living with Bridget Bardot.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <!-- Fallback to the original file --> <img src="/assets/img/blog/vanessa2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Vanessa carried guilt, feeling responsible for Maria’s departure from her sanctuary. The impact of Maria’s fame resonated within Vanessa’s family. Privately, Vanessa felt pride and affection for Maria, but other family members grappled with embarrassment over Maria’s indulgent and spontaneous lifestyle, which was observed by everyone around them. Vanessa’s parents, influenced by socialist ideas inspired by Mao, were financially constrained and donned unconventional clothing reminiscent of gypsies. Moreover, the presence of a sex symbol within their extended family, someone who would sporadically intrude into their lives, disrupt their peace, and then vanish in pursuit of drugs, significantly complicated Vanessa’s mental well-being during her formative years.</p> <p>Vanessa loved Maria, felt pity for her, and wanted the best for her. She could sense that Maria was a victim of female objectification in the 1970s film industry, even though her own family was somewhat victimized due to her fame. Although I’ve never personally experienced having a famous family member, I could perceive Vanessa’s internal turmoil and admiration. Vanessa’s narrative didn’t shy away from the complex emotions she harbored toward Maria, allowing readers to view her story as a firsthand account of growing up under the influence of a cousin, a recklessly-behaving movie star. This humility and authenticity in Vanessa’s memoir, where she acknowledges her biases and subjectivity, is truly commendable.</p> <p></p> <h3 id="so-nice-to-have-a">So nice to have “A”</h3> <p>“A” is an anonymous same-sex partner of Maria, who stayed with her until her death. “A” was a cinema student when she first met Maria. Proactively, “A” rescued Maria from drug addiction by taking her to Mexico to break ties with drugs and receive proper medication for six months. Maria successfully replaced drugs with “many” cigarettes and champagnes after the treatment, an achievement that no facility in France had managed. I assume that “A”’s constant presence and genuine care made a real impact. Love is giving someone your time.</p> <p>I wonder if it’s coincidental that talented and successful artists often end up with much younger same-sex partners. Simone de Beauvoir had a partner who was her student and created an archive by deciphering Beauvoir’s incomprehensible handwritten letters and collecting essays from various sources. Oliver Sacks’ partner, Bill Hayes, wrote a book titled “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Insomniac-City-New-York-Oliver/dp/1620404931">Insomniac City: New York, Oliver, and Me.</a>” The book is a memoir that recounts Hayes’ experiences living in NY and his personal reflections with Oliver Sacks. Hayes himself is a great writer who portrays the relationship with this smart, sensitive, witty, frank, and over 75 neurologist.</p> <p>These exceptionally intelligent and talented individuals have experienced significant challenges in their lives and somehow found stability with these younger partners who assisted in sorting out their health and work before their passing.</p> <p></p> <h3 id="i-felt-grateful">I felt grateful…</h3> <p>I felt gratitude in being surrounded by people who could create a fruit punch fountain, share their stories, and fill the air with laughter. I felt grateful to be living in an era where women are empowered to speak out against unjust objectification. I feel relieved that I know my rights and have people to turn to when facing difficulties. My wish is that all these privileges had been allowed to Maria’s life and would extend to the lives of all women.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <!-- Fallback to the original file --> <img src="/assets/img/blog/maria.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Rest in peace, Maria Schneider. </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Book_review"/><category term="books"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A refelction on biography.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Adieu, WordPress!</title><link href="https://inyoungcheong.github.io/blog/2023/adieu-wordpress/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Adieu, WordPress!"/><published>2023-08-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://inyoungcheong.github.io/blog/2023/adieu-wordpress</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://inyoungcheong.github.io/blog/2023/adieu-wordpress/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="why-having-my-own-website-matters">Why Having My Own Website Matters</h2> <p>Soon after I started my academic journey, one of my mentors advised that building a portfolio website is a crucial first step to claim a bit of visibility in academia. This digital space offers more than just information; it presents a glimpse of your authenticity as a “real person” affiliated with a legitimate institution.</p> <h2 id="i-started-with-wordpress">I started with WordPress</h2> <p>I knew that Wix.com has a student discount, a free one-year premium membership. But after that period, they will charge around $110. WordPress was a more affordable option, costing around $66 each year, although it doesn’t offer a student discount. So, I decided to give it a try.</p> <p>After some trials and errors, I managed to create this website.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <!-- Fallback to the original file --> <img src="/assets/img/blog/wordpress.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Not bad for a start, right? </div> <h3 id="my-mentor-was-right">My mentor was right.</h3> <p>To my surprise, the link to my website in my email signature started getting clicks, and my WordPress stat graph reflected this impact. About 10-20 visitors consistently visited my site. Hah!</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <!-- Fallback to the original file --> <img src="/assets/img/blog/view.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Hmm, who are these people? </div> <h3 id="yearning-for-more">Yearning for More</h3> <p>Despite WordPress’s user-friendly interface, template restrictions hindered my expression. Certain design elements were frustratingly out of reach. Gradually, my enthusiasm for updates waned, fuelling my desire for a self-designed, unrestricted website.</p> <h2 id="building-my-own-website">Building My Own Website?</h2> <p>Admittedly, I am not a coder (I’m more about reading the U.S. Code). The idea of writing code and working with terminals was daunting, but my desire for a truly personalized website pushed me to step out of my comfort zone after a year of WordPress subscription. I craved a platform offering both creative autonomy and an economical solution. After meticulous research, GitHub Pages and Jekyll emerged as my top contenders.</p> <p>What took me by surprise was GitHub’s offer of a free website domain: inyoungcheong.github.io. It doesn’t look shabby, maybe even cool, especially for someone like me who’s always regarded GitHub as a magical tech tool. Jekyll, a remarkable tool, seamlessly transforms GitHub Pages into a functional website. It’s as if you’re creating code on your computer, and then Jekyll, with its magic touch, deploys the code onto your GitHub Page, assembles the site, and gets everything running. While various programming languages and libraries, like Ruby and more, are involved, you don’t need an in-depth grasp of their intricate workings. Just choose your favourite Jekyll template and meticulously follow the step-by-step instructions.</p> <p>During this journey, I somewhat relinquished my pursuit of fully comprehending the logical thread connecting each step. Instead, I opted to forge ahead, embracing every aspect without dwelling too deeply on each nuance. If something faltered, I dived into troubleshooting mode. Admittedly, this process demands patience, but given the methodical, rule-based nature of the process, persistence eventually pays off.</p> <p>Transitioning into a code-centred environment was no minor undertaking. I embarked on a quest to acquaint myself with terminals, commands, and tools like Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Learning to write in Markdown, grasping YAML front matter, and deftly navigating the intricacies of version control swiftly became part of my daily routine.</p> <h2 id="its-not-always-pretty">It’s Not Always Pretty.</h2> <p>Of course, no journey is without its bumps and hurdles. Along the way, I encountered my fair share of bugs and experienced website breakdowns that tested my patience and problem-solving skills. Just before ICML 2023, my website finally broke apart, helplessly displaying the basic template (alfolio) website! Whew. I couldn’t figure out what I did wrong and didn’t know how to revert the Git changes, so I spent the conference week with my out-of-date WordPress website.</p> <h2 id="i-will-not-go-back">I Will Not Go Back.</h2> <p>As I write these words, I must acknowledge that my website is still a work in progress – a dynamic, living entity that continually transforms with every line of code I craft and every bug I mend. Imperfections notwithstanding, I take pride in what I have accomplished thus far.</p> <p>No longer bound by the constraints of pre-designed themes and templates, I found myself empowered to forge my website’s identity from the ground up. The journey of customization, though often arduous, was richly rewarding. Each tweak, every adjustment, seemed to align like pieces of a puzzle, gradually materialising the vision I had in mind. The sense of accomplishment I derived from this journey was nothing short of exhilarating. 😄🌟</p> <p>The most fascinating aspect is realizing that this website will continue to operate for free. As long as I have my computer, this online sanctuary isn’t going anywhere. I’ve had to change my virtual abode multiple times: Cyworld (a Korean version of Facebook) vanished, Facebook waned in significance, and Twitter was partially superseded by Mastodon (now re-branded as “X”).

I have never successfully moved on from scathing rejections; instead, I have lived through and with them.🤟🏻</em></p> <h2 id="invited-to-career-talk">Invited to Career Talk</h2> <p>I received an invitation to speak at the Korea Scientist-Engineers Association’s annual conference, UKC 2023, in Dallas, Texas. The conference includes a panel for the younger generation, and I was appointed to speak at the “Career Talk” session. I decided to take a chance because they offered me a plane ticket and hotel accommodation (Of course, I wanted to have real tacos in Texas). However, as the event drew closer, I became unsure about which aspects of my experiences might be helpful to younger scientists and engineers.</p> <p>After all, I am an ex-government employee and a 5-year PhD student. What could be interesting or inspiring about my journey? Government work is tough, law school is not easy, and pursuing interdisciplinary studies is not always enjoyable. What else can I share to make a meaningful impact on the audience?</p> <p>I came to my ground rule. When I am not sure what to speak, I will speak about what currently occupies my mind. Maybe it’s not incredibly hitting the spot of audience’s interest, but at least, my talk will deliver my genuity about the topic because I can’t stop thinking about it.</p> <h2 id="okay-rejections">Okay, Rejections!</h2> <p>As a 5-year PhD student, rejections have become a natural part of my day-to-day life. My proposals and write-ups have been rejected by numerous conferences, journals, fellowships, and internships. While well-meaning advice from others can offer comfort, sometimes it may not fully resonate with the emotions I experience. I couldn’t help but notice that rejections and self-doubt take a toll on my confidence, making me question my worth and abilities.</p> <p>Below is the presentation I created for the talk.</p> <iframe src="https://uwnetid-my.sharepoint.com/personal/icheon_uw_edu/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc={a0e5af5f-b6c5-4b86-8cc1-430d4552cb33}&amp;action=embedview&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777" width="476px" height="288px" frameborder="0">This is an embedded <a target="_blank" href="https://office.com">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target="_blank" href="https://office.com/webapps">Office</a>.</iframe> <h2 id="why-common-advice-does-not-help-you">Why Common Advice Does Not Help You</h2> <p>Below itemizes the common piece of advice for those who face rejections.</p> <h3 id="common-advice">Common Advice</h3> <ul> <li>“I believe in your talent and resilience."</li> <li>"Rejections are a natural part of the process; even the best writers face them."</li> <li>"Use this experience to grow and improve; it's an opportunity for learning and development."</li> <li>"Remember, every 'no' brings you closer to a 'yes.' Keep pushing forward."</li> <li>"I'm proud of you for putting your work out there; that takes courage and dedication."</li> <li>“This rejection is just a few editors’ perspective."</li> </ul> <p>These comments are absolutely right! (If these thoughts strike a chord with you, I am glad, and you’re fine to skip the rest of this post). However, when one is at their lowest point, these tips may not fully connect with their current state of mind. It can be challenging to empathize with this advice when their thoughts are telling them the opposite.</p> <h3 id="what-our-brains-telling-us">What Our Brains Telling Us</h3> <ul> <li>“I don't believe in my talent and resilience."</li> <li>"Rejections are a natural part of the process, but I have waited too long to see the results like any other good writers."</li> <li>"I have grown and improved a lot. I want to see the results! Maybe I am hopelessly incompetent."</li> <li>"I don't have energy anymore. I need a real 'yes' to keep pushing forward."</li> <li>"It took courage to put my work out there. That is why it's disappointing nobody recognizes my work's value. It speaks to how valueless my work is."</li> <li>“The rejection speaks to my inability to convince others of my work's contribution."</li> </ul> <p>For the past four years and even now, these self-negating statements have echoed persistently in my mind. It almost feels like a desperate attempt to protect my sanity by setting low expectations to avoid disappointment. Perhaps I blamed my negative emotions on having overly high expectations for positive outcomes, leading me to deny my own capabilities. If I convince myself that I am not qualified enough for certain opportunities, then I shouldn’t be devastated by rejection, right? By evaluating my abilities with a mindset of 99% failure and 1% success, I might find genuine happiness in the rare achievements while being able to pick myself up more easily after facing rejections.</p> <p>However, this self-negation hasn’t been entirely helpful, as it has instilled a fundamental doubt in my chosen career trajectory. I can’t help but question if I’m on the wrong path altogether. Should I consider a different career, one that aligns better with my abilities and aspirations? Constantly grappling with these uncertainties has led to a persistent state of anxiety, which has made me dislike my identity as a PhD student, as I’ve come to believe that academia might not be the right fit for me.</p> <h2 id="advices-actually-helpful">Advices Actually Helpful</h2> <p>At some point, as an another anxious and desperate move to protect my sanity, or from the belief in self-worth from the beneath of my heart, I did little thought experiment. Some of them somehow successfully lifted my spirit.</p> <blockquote> <h4 id="advice-1">Advice 1</h4> <p class="block-tip">“I am incredibly sad because I strongly wanted it.”</p> </blockquote> <p>When confronted with rejection, it’s natural to feel a profound sadness and question our own worth. However, in a moment of realization, I found a sense of solace in this poignant emotion. It dawned on me that the depth of my sadness was a reflection of just how much I truly desired the outcome I was seeking. Amidst the sea of rejections, I could refute the advice that questioned my abilities and potential, but I couldn’t deny the sheer intensity of my yearning for that desired result.</p> <p><strong>It wasn’t just any rejection; it was a profound testament to the depth of my care and dedication.</strong> This newfound perspective transformed my outlook, reminding me that the intensity of my emotions served as an <strong>affirmation of my unwavering passion and commitment</strong>. Instead of suppressing the pain, I embraced it as evidence of the dreams that meant so much to me.</p> <p>Not everyone is fortunate enough to identify and pursue their dreams, and I count myself among the lucky few who can. Therefore, the profound sadness I experienced stands as a testament to my unyielding and genuine pursuit of that dream, deserving both celebration and gratitude.</p> <blockquote> <h4 id="advice-2">Advice 2</h4> <p class="block-tip">“The sky is big enough to accommodate all of us.”</p> </blockquote> <p>While a specific path may sometimes appear narrow and challenging, it is worth to remind that the bigger picture includes hundreds of thousands of paths, each leading to its own set of possibilities.</p> <p>Imagine a stranger asking you, “Do you think the sky is big enough to accommodate everyone to flourish?” For me, the answer is a yes. I maintain a general sense of hope for the abundance of opportunities the future holds for everyone. Though I’m not an overly optimistic person and acknowledge that societal and systemic factors may create barriers and limitations that can impact individuals’ ability. However, I still possess a high-level belief in the potential of the human world. If a teenage neighbor were to share their dreams with me, I would wholeheartedly believe that they are achievable and would eagerly seek resources to support their aspirations. This optimism toward others’ possibilities has also been helpful for me in maintaining a long-term perspective on my own journey.</p> <p>So, if I were to advise a young researcher struggling with academic frustrations 20 years from now, my response would be a resounding “no” to their pessimism. Instead, I would remain positive and encourage them to keep pursuing their goals, seeking feedback from peers and mentors along the way. I would assure them that with persistence and dedication, they will find a meaningful place in their field in the near future. And this high-level advice applies just as much to myself in the present as it would to that young researcher in the future.</p> <p>This shift in focus, guided by the idea of the vast sky, enables me to let go of self-criticism and embrace the boundless possibilities that lie ahead. Visualization of this statement has proven to be remarkably powerful, allowing me to release the grip of self-doubt.</p> <blockquote> <h4 id="advice-3">Advice 3</h4> <p class="block-tip">“Engaging in interdisciplinary studies is comparable to dropping a stone into the depths of water, leading to the formation of an intellectual island rising above the surface.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Recently, a paper I had revised multiple times faced three consecutive rejections. Doubts about my capabilities as a researcher began to creep in, especially since the research had reached its conclusion in 2022. The confusion about whether to persist or move on intensified.</p> <p>In those moments, my supportive PhD advisor, Tadayoshi Kohno, shared a valuable insight. He likened interdisciplinary research to throwing stones into water, explaining that it takes time to make an impact. While the water may initially swallow the stones, continued efforts will eventually create a profound impact like a majestic iceberg. The professor assured me that people might only notice the tip, not realizing the tremendous effort hidden beneath.</p> <div class="caption"> Iceberg built by hidden effort </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <!-- Fallback to the original file --> <img src="/assets/img/blog/frustration.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <!-- Fallback to the original file --> <img src="/assets/img/blog/frustration2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <!-- Fallback to the original file --> <img src="/assets/img/blog/frustration3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>My advisor wrote this <a href="https://yoshi-kohno.medium.com/unseen-phd-effort-failures-and-the-research-iceberg-analogy-advice-for-phd-students-954e5959370e">article</a> on Medium about the island analogy about the general PhD experience, which I highly recommend.</p> <p>This visualization experiment was remarkably helpful as it served to validate and acknowledge the worth of my rejected efforts. While some reviewers may not have recognized its value, I did, and I likened it to casting a stone into the water, contributing to the foundation of my island of knowledge. Thus, it holds great significance and is by no means meaningless. As my island emerges above the surface, this seemingly insignificant stone, once tagged with frustration, will prove to be an essential element of my approach, playing a crucial role in my academic journey.</p> <h3 id="conclusion-hang-in-there">Conclusion-Hang in There!</h3> <p>My journey as a PhD student has been filled with challenges, rejections, and moments of self-doubt. Yet, I’ve come to realize that these experiences, though painful, are not signs of failure, but rather stepping stones towards growth and learning. Throughout this process, I’ve embraced the sadness that accompanies rejection, understanding that it signifies the depth of my passion and dedication to my dreams.</p> <p>To me, Engaging in thought experiments to challenge conventional advice has proven highly beneficial. This shift in perspective, moving from inward to outward, has been facilitated by the powerful metaphors of the vast sky and the emerging intellectual island. Through this new lens, I’ve been able to transcend the limitations of present challenges and embrace a broader vision for my academic journey. Much like dropping stones into water, my interdisciplinary research efforts may not always yield immediate results, but I firmly believe that they will lay the groundwork for a strong and resilient foundation, shaping the essence of my own island.</p> <p>As I continue to navigate this path, I am grateful for the valuable advice and insights from my advisor and the unwavering support of those around me. I remain committed to pushing forward, knowing that every rejection and setback is a chance to emerge stronger and more resilient. With determination and an open mind, I look forward to the unknown adventures (and struggles) that await me in this academic journey.</p> <blockquote> Those of every successful scholar I know make clear that while the process of discovery is exciting and gratifying, anyone who devotes a life the narrow confines of scholarship will inevitably have to confront frustration, anger, confusion, and one or another form of self-doubt. —Julius Getman, The Company of Scholars: The Struggle for the Soul of Higher Education (1992) </blockquote>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Academic"/><category term="Life"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Personal tips for emotional burnt out due to academic rejections]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How I Handle Academic Rejections</title><link href="https://inyoungcheong.github.io/blog/2023/handling-rejections/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How I Handle Academic Rejections"/><published>2023-07-21T14:14:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-21T14:14:00+00:00</updated><id>https://inyoungcheong.github.io/blog/2023/handling-rejections</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://inyoungcheong.github.io/blog/2023/handling-rejections/"><![CDATA[<h3 id="hello-dallas">Hello, Dallas!</h3> <p>A free travel is what PhD students adore the most. I had a privilege to visit Dallas, right after a travel to Hawaii for the ICML2023, as a guest speaker for the Korean-American Scientist-Engineers Association’s <a href="https://www.ukc.ksea.org/">UKC 2023</a>. I gave a talk about academic frustrations as an interdiscplinary scholar between law and computer science.</p> <h3 id="ksea-ukc-fire-wow-very-korean">KSEA, UKC, FIRE… wow, very Korean!</h3> <p>There’s a lot to say about this conference (I did not know that the CEO of Elsevier was a Korean!) and its branch group called FIRE for younger-generation scientists and engineers. This conference spans across extremely varied disciplines from agriculture, pharma, bio, computer science, to bias research, and so many small themes/groups/sponsors/workshops are woven together, but somehow very carefully managed under a centralized governance.</p> <p>ICML2023 was super big (over 7,000 participants?!), somewhat loose, and decentralized: Each participant was supposed to navigate their own ways. But in KSEA UKC, I was given very clear roles/expectations and the organizers made sure I participated in every role I committed to and they pre-arranged for me. It’s a lot of work for them and me, but at least, I felt that no one would be isolated during the conference due to this meticulous planning and implementation.</p> <h3 id="my-talk-about-academic-frustrations">My talk about Academic Frustrations</h3> <p>I am by no means a master of overcoming academic frustrations, actually the opposite. I have never successfully moved on from scathing rejections. I have lived through/with them.</p> <p>Although my talk is entitled “Career Flash Talk,” I didn’t much to share my “highlights,” yet. My transitions from public policy to interdisciplinary research can be intriguing, but I have not been in the mood for bragging about it. To be honest, there was nothing to brag about.</p> <p>Thus, I decided to share my genuine frustrations (that potentially relate to many people across disciplines) and small tips that I have tried to familarize myself with. Here is my presentation file. I hope that I will break down each tips into the blog post soon.
