A free travel is what PhD students adore the most. I had a privilege to visit Dallas, right after a travel to Hawaii for the ICML2023, as a guest speaker for the Korean-American Scientist-Engineers Association's <a href="https://www.ukc.ksea.org/">UKC 2023</a>. I gave a talk about academic frustrations as an interdiscplinary scholar between law and computer science. If you want to know more, please check out my blog post!
