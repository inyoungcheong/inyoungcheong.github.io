 I was honored to be invited as the first speaker at TrustLab's event. I gave a talk about legal implications of generative AI technology--especially focusing on free speech, equality, privacy, and Section 230. I had delightful experience into the collaborative efforts of engineers, social scientists, and policy experts, all working harmoniously to shape a safer and more reliable technological future. Special thanks to the organizer Emma Tilley, also a PhD student, is exceptionally attentive and cordial. ::smile::
