<i>I've open-sourced the code for my website on GitHub - feel free to tinker with your own version <a href="https://github.com/inyoungcheong/inyoungcheong.github.io">here</a>.</i>


### Three Months with Github Page. 

It's hard to believe it's already been three or four months since I created this website (my reflection on this release is [here](https://inyoungcheong.github.io/blog/2023/adieu-wordpress/)). At this stage of life, I value archiving memories in ANY form, so I'm recapping my experience building this site.

I had to learn Visual Studio, GitHub, and Jekyll (specifically the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) template) to construct the site. As I described earlier, picking up these new skills as a non-programmer was a steep curve! However, I appreciate everything being free - no URL fees, unlimited uploads, embedding abilities.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/Screenshot.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    On my current screen. 
</div>

The mobile experience can be glitchy, like my CV not displaying on certain browsers. But overall, I like having full control to add anything I want by finding solutions through Google. In just a few months, I've gained new tech skills while creating a personalized platform to preserve memories. Though challenging at times, it's been a worthwhile endeavor.

### What I didn't like ...

However, as you can see, I haven't uploaded as much academic writing on tech law as I would have liked. These topics require critical thinking and substantial literature review. Staring at the blank screen in Visual Studio soon sapped my motivation for such mentally taxing writing. The programmer-like working environment poses a major obstacle, unless I'm doing something inherently enjoyable like a [book review](https://inyoungcheong.github.io/blog/2023/maria-schneider/) or reunion announcement for my [Korean friends](https://inyoungcheong.github.io/blog/2023/jeonmindong/).

Because I was preoccupied with learning the basics of Jekyll and GitHub Pages, I didn't make many customizations to the Al-folio [template](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/). 

<div class="row mt-3">
   <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/website.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/alfoliosample.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

However, there were a few points I wasn't satisfied with:
- Limited news items. Some people have long publication lists which look impressive (e.g. [Chan Young](https://chan0park.github.io/) and [Amy](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~axz/)).
- Al-folio is very popular, so many sites look identical. I wanted my site to have an authentic style.
- Fancy icons for selected publications take up too much space.
- As my blogging becomes more personal, people in my professional network may not need to see these posts on the main page.

### Updates and Helpful Resources
My partner üë®üèª‚Äçüé® gave me candid feedback on my lengthy intro paragraph: "Nobody will read all this." He suggested highlighting just my core titles like PhD Candidate and OpenAI grant recipient. Additional details could live on separate pages, avoiding one dense intro. While implementing separate pages felt too complex, I did add resume-style hashtags below my headshot.


#### 1. Pantone Color Palette üé®
To differentiate my site from the popular al-folio template, I customized the colors in _sass/_themes.scss and _sass/_variables.scss. I used [Pantone's 2023 Color of the Year palette](https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year/2023) for a cohesive look, choosing magenta for highlighted texts and hyperlinks.

Choosing the right background color for my headshot took time. I landed on a salmon-pink hue called "Pale Dogwood" from the Pantone palette. This warm, muted tone pairs nicely with the vibrant magenta accents.

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

#### 2. Pixlr Photomash 
I used one of my Instagram photos for my profile headshot. To give it a more designed look, I edited it with [Pixlr Photomash](https://pixlr.com/photomash/). This free online tool lets you transform photos with one click.
I've used Pixlr for years as a web-based Photoshop alternative. While PixlrX and the background remover now have paywalls, Photomash remains free. It offers numerous quick style options to creatively customize images.

<div class="row mt-3">
   <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/pixlr.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row mt-3">
   <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/profile.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/profile3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/profile6.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>
<br>

#### 3. Interactive Table 
I removed the al-folio news/publications template and instead used this markdown code for my About page updates:
<br>
````markdown
```c++
<p><strong><i> title </i></strong></p>
<table>
  <colgroup>
    <col width="20%" />
    <col width="80%" />
  </colgroup>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span"> year </td>
      <td markdown="span"> content </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span"> year </td>
      <td markdown="span"> content </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td markdown="span"> year </td>
      <td markdown="span"> content </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```
````
<div class="caption">
    Sorry, it's all magenta. You can make it visible by highlighting the lines of code. üòëü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
</div>
<br>
This code generated a clean, interactive table. Though satisfied overall, removing the header row sometimes caused errors - I'm still investigating why.
<br>

#### 4. Google Fonts
I was impressed by the huge selection of free fonts on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)üôè. With easy CSS integration, these web fonts smoothly customized my site's typography.

### Final Look!
The current homepage looks like this:
<br>
<div class="row mt-3">
   <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog/website2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Version of 10-24-2023.
    </div>

Overhauling my site's appearance took about two full days of effort. It required substantial work, but was time well spent to achieve a more polished, personalized aesthetic. With this updated design, Hopefully, it will further engage me in producing more website content.ü§û
