## Why Having My Own Website Matters

Soon after I embarked on my academic journey, my mentor wisely advised that building a portfolio website is a crucial first step towards carving a distinct niche in the vast landscape of academia. This digital space, akin to a dynamic CV, offers more than just information; it presents a glimpse of your authenticity as a "real person" affiliated with a legitimate institution.

## I started with WordPress

I knew that Wix.com has a student discount, a free one-year premium membership. But after that period, they will charge around $110. WordPress was a more affordable option, costing around $66 each year, although it doesn't offer a student discount. So, I decided to give it a try.

After some trials and errors, I managed to create this website.


## My mentor was right.

To my surprise, the link to my website in my email signature started getting clicks, and my WordPress stat graph reflected this impact. About 10-20 visitors consistently visited my site. Hah!


## Yearning for More: My WordPress Quandary

Despite WordPress's user-friendly interface, template restrictions hindered my creative expression. Certain design elements were frustratingly out of reach. Gradually, my enthusiasm for updates waned, fuelling my desire for a self-designed, unrestricted website.

## Building My Own Website?

Admittedly, I am not a coder (I'm more about reading the U.S. Code). The idea of writing code and working with terminals was daunting, but my desire for a truly personalized website pushed me to step out of my comfort zone after a year of WordPress subscription. I craved a platform offering both creative autonomy and an economical solution. After meticulous research, GitHub Pages and Jekyll emerged as my top contenders.

What took me by surprise was GitHub's offer of a free website domain: inyoungcheong.github.io. It doesn't look shabby, maybe even cool, especially for someone like me who's always regarded GitHub as a magical tech tool. Jekyll, a remarkable tool, seamlessly transforms GitHub Pages into a functional website. It's as if you're creating code on your computer, and then Jekyll, with its magic touch, deploys the code onto your GitHub Page, assembles the site, and gets everything running. While various programming languages and libraries, like Ruby and more, are involved, you don't need an in-depth grasp of their intricate workings. Just choose your favourite Jekyll template and meticulously follow the step-by-step instructions.

During this journey, I somewhat relinquished my pursuit of fully comprehending the logical thread connecting each step. Instead, I opted to forge ahead, embracing every aspect without dwelling too deeply on each nuance. If something faltered, I dived into troubleshooting mode. Admittedly, this process demands patience, but given the methodical, rule-based nature of the process, persistence eventually pays off.

Transitioning into a code-centred environment was no minor undertaking. I embarked on a quest to acquaint myself with terminals, commands, and tools like Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Learning to write in Markdown, grasping YAML front matter, and deftly navigating the intricacies of version control swiftly became part of my daily routine.

## It's Not Always Pretty.

Of course, no journey is without its bumps and hurdles. Along the way, I encountered my fair share of bugs and experienced website breakdowns that tested my patience and problem-solving skills. Just before ICML 2023, my website finally broke apart, helplessly displaying the basic template (alfolio) website! Whew. I couldn't figure out what I did wrong and didn't know how to revert the Git changes, so I spent the conference week with my out-of-date WordPress website.

## I Will Not Go Back.

As I write these words, I must acknowledge that my website is still a work in progress â€“ a dynamic, living entity that continually transforms with every line of code I craft and every bug I mend. Imperfections notwithstanding, I take pride in what I have accomplished thus far.

No longer bound by the constraints of pre-designed themes and templates, I found myself empowered to forge my website's identity from the ground up. The journey of customisation, though often arduous, was richly rewarding. Each tweak, every adjustment, seemed to align like pieces of a puzzle, gradually materialising the vision I had in mind. The sense of accomplishment I derived from this journey was nothing short of exhilarating. ðŸ˜„ðŸŒŸ

Perhaps the most gratifying aspect is the assurance that this website will endure, even in times when financial constraints might arise. As long as I have my trusty computer by my side, this digital haven will stand strong. The thought of this self-sufficiency â€“ a testament to both my commitment and the power of open-source tools â€“ brings a hearty chuckle and a reassuring sigh of relief.
